# Hi there. I'm Allison
I'm a Melbourne based Software Engineer who's passionate about all things programming. I love a good challenge and will do everything I can to solve any problems that come my way.

## My Coding Journey

I've always loved coding ever since I was introduced to it at the ripe age of 10 years old. I dabbled in game programming before fully experiencing its capabilities at 13 by creating my first website using HTML and CSS. It was only natural for me to follow up my Secondary School life with Computer Science and going further with Software Engineering in particular.

## What I'm working on

### [Terminal Emulator](https://github.com/AlliGrass/terminal-rock-paper-scissors)
Full-Stack application that allows the user to use the terminal effectively as well as run various programs from the terminal.

### [Personal Portfolio](https://alligrass.dev)
I am always working on my portfolio to keep it up to date with my current skillset and capabilities

## Previous Projects

### [Australian Petrol Station ](https://github.com/AlliGrass/Servo-project3)
A group collaboration project that shows all the available petrol stations in Australia. Uses various APIs and keys to be able to accomplish the interactive map. Completed within 4 days.
