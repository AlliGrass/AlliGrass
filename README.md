# Hi there. I'm Allison
I'm a Melbourne based Software Engineer who's passionate about all things programming. I love a good challenge and will do everything I can to solve any problems that come my way.

## My Coding Journey

I've always loved coding ever since I was introduced to it at the ripe age of 10 years old. I dabbled in game programming before fully experiencing its capabilities at 13 by creating my first website using HTML and CSS. It was only natural for me to follow up my Secondary School life with Computer Science and going further with Software Engineering in particular.

## What I'm working on

### Calculator Mobile App
It is currently in its foundational stage as I am learning Kotlin/Android Studio. This will be updated as I make further progress on the project

### [Memory Enhancement Games](https://github.com/AlliGrass/memory-enhancement)
As I am currently in the process of learning two different languages I am committed to creating software that will improve my learning process. At this point in time it is only suitable for my personal vocabulary lists, however there is potential to customise them for a better experience in the near future. Starting as a browser application I am hoping to migrate this onto mobile platforms once the program is more fleshed out.

### [Personal Portfolio](https://alligrass.dev)
I am always working on my portfolio to keep it up to date with my current skillset and capabilities

## Previous Projects

### Java Terminal Programs 
Several terminal based applications using Java

- [Insurance + Policy](https://github.com/AlliGrass/Insurance-System) - Create customers for their insurance choices and apply policies. Fully developed for the use of staff personel

## Future Projects

### AI Desktop Helper
I intend to create an AI in the future which will be purely conversation to start off with. In future there will be plenty of opportunities to expand on this project.
